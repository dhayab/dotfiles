# dotfiles

This repository uses the excellent [@atomantic/dotfiles](https://github.com/atomantic/dotfiles) project as the base, and has been changed to my preferences.

## Installation

Open Terminal (not iTerm) and run this:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dhayab/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

Follow the original [README.md](https://github.com/atomantic/dotfiles#readme) to understand how this works. Also, just to be clear...
